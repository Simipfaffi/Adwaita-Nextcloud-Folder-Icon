A simple Nextcloud folder icon, adapted to the Adwaita icon theme by GNOME. 
I believe that some of you are looking for such a simple folder icon for the Adwaita theme. That's why I created this little repository. 
I created the icon in the vector graphics program [Boxy SVG](https://boxy-svg.com/) . 

Installation:
Set the icon by clicking on the current folder icon in the folder settings (can be found by right-clicking on the folder).  You can then select the new Nextcloud folder icon.



**Have fun with it :-)**
